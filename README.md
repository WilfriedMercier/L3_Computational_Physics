# L3_Computational_Physics

## Description

Undergraduate Project in third year at Bristol. There were three projects:

1. Testing LU and SVD methods against a raw invert method. Solving a linear system to study the force within the cables of a camera system/
2. Solving partial differential equations (Laplace's equation for a capacitor Electric Field and potential) as well as the heat equation
3. Generating random numbers with the rejection technique and using toy models to constrain an upper limit on a cross-section.
